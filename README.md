# Challenge-1-Repository
First weekly challenge for grading 
 
 ## Description 
 
 This assignment was a refactoring job. Here, we were given starter code and had to contribute to the existing codebase in order to both meet industry standards, as well as make the page accessible.
 For this mock webpage, I used the skills I learned during my first week in Bootcamp to edit html and css files. 
 
 While working on this assignment, I continued to expand my knowledge on html and css, and now that it's complete, feel that my understanding of both reading and writing in these languages has improved. 
 I also became much more familiar using git commands in the terminal, because it was essential to create a working branch of my repo, as well as push multiple commits. 
 
 ## Installation
 
 No installation needed, simply open the index file in your browser of choice, or go to the website being hosted by github!
